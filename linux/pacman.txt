Pacman Guide

To update the system
sudo pacman -Syu

sudo pacman -Syy

Installing
To install a package (always run pacman -Syu, before installing):
sudo pacman -S package_name

To install a local package, or from a website:
sudo pacman -U /path/to/the/package

To re-install all packages (those from the repo’s), in case of emergency:
pacman -Qnq | pacman -S - 

Removing Packages
If you want to only remove the package, the following command is sufficient:
sudo pacman -R

To remove the package and those of its dependencies that aren’t needed by any other application, do
sudo pacman -Rs

Finally, to remove the package, avoid orphaned dependencies and erase its global configuration, type
sudo pacman -Rns package_name

which in most cases is the proper command to remove software.
